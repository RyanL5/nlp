sound
Positive:
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
for me the sound of the music is what is important .
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
the sound quality is also nice .
also , the sound is wonderful .
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
bummer as it has great sound quality .
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it   likes   - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price   - best in class sound   - large easy readable screen   depressingly poor quality .
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
sound :   the sound from the player is ok .
the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates .
if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
summary :   lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
pros :   excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
one major complaint :   my only significant complaint is sound quality .
the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with `` bass boost .
the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
sound quality is amazing .
the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit   + screen was good , easy to read   + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
pros :   great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's `` unspecified `` ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
pros summary :   great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes   cons summary :   not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording   bottom-line :   can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software [ t ] a great player , excellent sound quality , hovewer , has flaws .
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
pros :   great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
the sound quality is very good .
Negative:
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
neutral:
overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
ipod
Positive:
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
dislikes   - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it   likes   - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price   - best in class sound   - large easy readable screen   depressingly poor quality .
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
price :   the price compared to the ipod is great .
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
lastly , the price is fantastic :   i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute .
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as `` sexy `` looking .
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
pros :   great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's `` unspecified `` ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about `` white noise `` in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :   look / design :   the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
Negative:
when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )   hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect .
everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
neutral:
yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs .
it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is `` trendy `` to have that player .
i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1 .
i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
i guess that 's why you so often see `` ipodders `` bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole `` i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you .
size - bigger than the ipod   software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .
i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .
way less expensive than the ipod .
i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa .
my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time .
most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
the reason for this the ipod has `` a better user interface `` .
so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you can not make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
review of zen xtra - 40 gb   the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .
the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything .
granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
conclusion :   if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
whereas some folks have the `` ipod `` , i have the `` nomad jukebox zen xtra `` ( not to be confused with the `` nomad jukebox zen nx `` ) .
i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .
i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it `` unnecessary `` and `` so 20th century `` .
sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
zen
Positive:
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as `` sexy `` looking .
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
pros :   great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's `` unspecified `` ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery   cons :   battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive   note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that `` creates `` folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
Negative:
when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
neutral:
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ) .
notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes .
my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2 .
i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .
if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time .
so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
review of zen xtra - 40 gb   the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .
since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the `` duplicate name `` problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 .
if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
conclusion :   if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;   i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;   i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
whereas some folks have the `` ipod `` , i have the `` nomad jukebox zen xtra `` ( not to be confused with the `` nomad jukebox zen nx `` ) .
i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219 .
the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is `` sold out `` or more likely `` discontinued `` at the almighty amazon .
the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .
the zen has no stop button .
like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
music
Positive:
for me the sound of the music is what is important .
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
this is a good deal for music and data storage .
this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
- uploading music is quick and easy .
pros :   excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;   i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit   + screen was good , easy to read   + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about `` white noise `` in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )   now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and `` explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player `` to replace the mediasource .
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
Negative:
this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop   the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display   the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said   software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on   the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage   it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course   so .
for the average music listener not expecting much .
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
cons : plug and play [ -1 ]   1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
neutral:
yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
that 's important because i have a lot of music .
notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc .
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
size - bigger than the ipod   software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .
over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus .
despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 .
my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 .
to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;   i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;   i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
c.   9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called `` unknown .
when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
files
Positive:
i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
then sorting the files is easy as pie .
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;   i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )   now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and `` explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player `` to replace the mediasource .
you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
Negative:
the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
cons : plug and play [ -1 ]   1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
3 ) folders can not be created for the audio files .
this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
experience :   once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
neutral:
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc .
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
getting files onto it is quick and painless .
once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song .
the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ) .
i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 .
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
software
Positive:
the software is great .
transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
pros : software [ +2 ]   software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money ) price [ +2 ]   much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate   no issues as of yet   cons : headphone [ -3 ]   you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck   hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you .
i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
but the major problem i had was with the software .
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
final verdict :   a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
it referred to a `` microsoft jet database engine `` error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;   i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .
third party software to the rescue   after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit   + screen was good , easy to read   + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .
pros summary :   great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes   cons summary :   not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording   bottom-line :   can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery   cons :   battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive   note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that `` creates `` folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this   con :   the software , mediasource , can not work on my pc .
in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software [ t ] a great player , excellent sound quality , hovewer , has flaws .
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's `` notmad `` software because of some advanced features i wanted .
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
Negative:
the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop   the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display   the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said   software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on   the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage   it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course   so .
on my main computer the software did not work right .
i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
software is absolutely terrible :   will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ) .
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
- the software that came with it was tough to load .
3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
neutral:
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ) .
notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
size - bigger than the ipod   software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical   - included creative software is pretty poor .
after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2 .
the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of `` please register with us so we can spam your inbox `` .
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
software :   i 've had no problems with the software .
is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )   i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
i would recommend replacing the existing software with the `` notmad explorer , `` which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore `` the `` when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
software :   a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the `` year `` field .
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 .
given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ) .
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
creative software stinks .
neutral :   i did n't even try the included software .
i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
software :   as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
battery
Positive:
even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
the battery is nice .
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
pros :   price / gb of storage   storage capacity   user replaceable battery   cons :   fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )   scroll button / switch   the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
the reason it does not get 5 stars   1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
pros summary :   great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes   cons summary :   not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording   bottom-line :   can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery   cons :   battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive   note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
pros :   great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
Negative:
the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
one minor complaint :   the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
cons :   short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
neutral:
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
pros :   price and capacity   slick-looking design and improved interface   removable battery   cons :   protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
price
Positive:
i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
pros : software [ +2 ]   software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money ) price [ +2 ]   much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate   no issues as of yet   cons : headphone [ -3 ]   you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck   hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it   likes   - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price   - best in class sound   - large easy readable screen   depressingly poor quality .
pros :   price / gb of storage   storage capacity   user replaceable battery   cons :   fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )   scroll button / switch   the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
price :   the price compared to the ipod is great .
for the price and features it is really good .
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
lastly , the price is fantastic :   i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
summary :   lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
the pros and cons of it :   great price .
final verdict :   a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
overall , a good buy for the price .
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery   cons :   battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive   note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
pros :   great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
Negative:
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
but with a low price , comes lower quality .
neutral:
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
pros :   price and capacity   slick-looking design and improved interface   removable battery   cons :   protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
the pros : price [ +2 ]   price !
the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
case
Positive:
pros : software [ +2 ]   software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money ) price [ +2 ]   much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate   no issues as of yet   cons : headphone [ -3 ]   you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck   hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )   the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .
pros :   price / gb of storage   storage capacity   user replaceable battery   cons :   fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )   scroll button / switch   the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
Negative:
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop   the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display   the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said   software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on   the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage   it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course   so .
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
third , the poor design continues with the case .
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
neutral:
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
not sure , if customer rep.   in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
pros :   price and capacity   slick-looking design and improved interface   removable battery   cons :   protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
thing
Positive:
i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans .
( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )   the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
other than that this thing is great .
on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
this thing seriously is a good player though .
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean !
one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as `` sexy `` looking .
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
good thing i got a replacement plan .
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , `` if the product seems broken , we can not help , `` or something to that effect .
if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly   2 .
battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
Negative:
this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
that 's probably a bad thing .
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop   the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display   the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said   software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on   the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage   it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course   so .
structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .
that 's the first thing to understand .
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
neutral:
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic .
one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
i guess that 's why you so often see `` ipodders `` bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole `` i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you .
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .
i love the storage in this thing .
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ) .
it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .
i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech .
the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
this thing is trash .
creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.   do n't buy this thing .
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
the storage capacity is great for me --   i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything .
while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .
despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .
i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
so now i 've got to call their customer `` service `` ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
it took several days of attempts before things finally `` worked `` again and i have n't a clue why .
i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
cons :   the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the `` rigor `` of a business traveler .
this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc .
if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of `` now playing `` interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
quality
Positive:
you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans .
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
the sound quality is also nice .
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
bummer as it has great sound quality .
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it   likes   - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price   - best in class sound   - large easy readable screen   depressingly poor quality .
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
summary :   lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
one major complaint :   my only significant complaint is sound quality .
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with `` bass boost .
the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
sound quality is amazing .
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit   + screen was good , easy to read   + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software [ t ] a great player , excellent sound quality , hovewer , has flaws .
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
the sound quality is very good .
Negative:
so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
construction quality is a difficult item .
but with a low price , comes lower quality .
neutral:
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ) .
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
unit
Positive:
( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )   the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit   + screen was good , easy to read   + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
Negative:
updating the unit 's firmware :   when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
is my unit defective ?
neutral:
i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2 .
well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year `` no questions asked `` replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
summary   overall i like the unit .
fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .
details :   do n't drop this unit :   i 've had the player for about a month now .
i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled `` on `` button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
mp3 player
Positive:
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
pros : software [ +2 ]   software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money ) price [ +2 ]   much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate   no issues as of yet   cons : headphone [ -3 ]   you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck   hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
this thing seriously is a good player though .
you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
sound :   the sound from the player is ok .
artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .
otherwise , this player is awesome !
overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players   all in all suprisingly easy to use .
the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
i purchased this player last week .
i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with `` bass boost .
the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .
first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
final verdict :   a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ) .
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player storage [ +2 ]   12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery   cons :   battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive   note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )   now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and `` explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player `` to replace the mediasource .
in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software [ t ] a great player , excellent sound quality , hovewer , has flaws .
alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
that player is a complete piece of sh *** .
now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
do not buy this product --   i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .

my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
Negative:
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
the bottom line :   if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
one minor complaint :   the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .
not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense .
i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :   flash card memory vs.   mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )   hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
cons : plug and play [ -1 ]   1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
experience :   once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
the bottom line :   if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :   flash card memory vs.   mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )   hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
neutral:
yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic .
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is `` trendy `` to have that player .
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes .
i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
i guess that 's why you so often see `` ipodders `` bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole `` i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you .
i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
i love this player .
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
details :   do n't drop this unit :   i 've had the player for about a month now .
one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech .
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
conclusion :  this player is an ideal purchase .
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1 .
this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .
if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .
creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 .
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
c.   9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc .
repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist   - you just have to buy a new player .
i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is `` player either not connected or busy .
honestly , i love this player .
ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw .
i hope my next player doesnt breakdown .
honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .

nomad
Positive:
i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
i love my new nomad , its great !
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery   cons :   battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive   note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
Negative:
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
cons : plug and play [ -1 ]   1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .
i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ) .
neutral:
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc .
i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
whereas some folks have the `` ipod `` , i have the `` nomad jukebox zen xtra `` ( not to be confused with the `` nomad jukebox zen nx `` ) .
i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is `` sold out `` or more likely `` discontinued `` at the almighty amazon .
this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
computer
Positive:
the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you .
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players   all in all suprisingly easy to use .
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit   + screen was good , easy to read   + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )   now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and `` explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player `` to replace the mediasource .
some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
Negative:
on my main computer the software did not work right .
i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
neutral:
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2 .
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .
this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;   i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;   i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
that is , if a folder on your computer called `` mp3 `` has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
product
Positive:
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .
with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
third party software to the rescue   after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , `` if the product seems broken , we can not help , `` or something to that effect .
do not buy this product --   i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
Negative:
overall , a very disappointing product .
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
neutral:
one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
this product is too fragile for normal use .
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
and we all know about the rush to market on new products .
i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
i will never buy a creative product again .
all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .
the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .
like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
drive
Positive:
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players   all in all suprisingly easy to use .
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
pros :   great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's `` unspecified `` ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player storage [ +2 ]   12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
Negative:
buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :   flash card memory vs.   mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )   hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .
( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )   well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
neutral:
despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1 .
i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc .
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )   i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .
the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ) .
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc .
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
recommendations :   1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
songs
Positive:
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates .
this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
second , the `` automatic `` sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit   + screen was good , easy to read   + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player storage [ +2 ]   12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
Negative:
in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ) .
it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect .
software is absolutely terrible :   will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ) .
songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
neutral:
with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :   transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1 .
so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .
if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ) .
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty .
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags .
the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get `` stuck `` rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc .
a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is `` player either not connected or busy .
it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do .
people
Positive:
30gb is more than enough for most people .
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
Negative:
besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )   well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
neutral:
i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
software :   a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw .
for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
